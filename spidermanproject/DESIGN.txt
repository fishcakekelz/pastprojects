Method left in Functions file:
I left getImageList() in the Functions.java file because I felt like
it worked independently from the other functions as well as the other
images funcs.



Ambiguous Methods:

TransformNotFull/Full - I put these in Entity because a lot of the manipulation was
                        involved in it but it could have also gone in WorldModel and
                        EventScheduler since both create entities as well.

createAnimationAction/createActivityAction - I put this in Entity because the methods are
                                             going to create an animation or action for each
                                             entity but it could have also been put in Action
                                             since it's doing a type of action.

create - This method went in Entity since it's creating a new unique entity but it could have gone
         in WorldModel since it keep track of what's in the world in terms of
         the entities and background elements.
